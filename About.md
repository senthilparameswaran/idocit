## About iDocIt! ##
iDocIt! is an Eclipse-based editor for API documentation. It analyses the identifiers of an interface and suggests aspects to document based on this analysis. By applying this approach it helps to write more complete high quality API-documentation. It currently supports WSDL- and Java-interfaces and could easily be extended with more languages.

iDocIt! has been designed and developed in the context of the dissertation-project of [Jan Christian Krause](http://nats-www.informatik.uni-hamburg.de/User/JanChristianKrause) at the IT-consultancy [AKRA GmbH](http://www.akra.de), located in Hamburg Germany. AKRA wants to continue iDocIt!'s development together with the open source community. Therefore we published the complete source code at Google Code under the Apache Licence.

The Eclipse Plugin has been implemented by Dirk Meier-Eickhoff and is well described in his bachelor-thesis (available for download [here](http://code.google.com/p/idocit/downloads/list), in german).

The thematic grids used to classify operations within iDocIt! are based on the work of the Verbnet-team lead by Martha Palmer. Verbnet has been used as a starting point to derive the operation-categories
empirically from. We thank Martha and her team for the nice and competent support and their pleased answers to all our questions around Verbnet.

Paul and his colleagues (Felix Bachmann, Len Bass, David Garlan, James Ivers, Reed Little, Robert Nord and Judith Stafford) describe different groups of stakeholders of interface documentation in their great book <a href='http://www.informit.com/store/product.aspx?isbn=0201703726'>"Documenting Software Architectures - Views and Beyond"</a> (page 237 and following). The groups of stakeholders described there have been used as default addressees within iDocIt!.
