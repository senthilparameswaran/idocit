# Introduction #

# Example of new Javadoc #

This is a first draft designed by Dirk and Jan Christian:

```
/**
 * Devloper text for ACTION.
 * 
 * @param customer
 *            {@attribute firstName COMPARISON}
 * 
 *            {@adressee Devloper: ARCHITECT <code>null</code> is not
 *            permitted here!}
 * 
 *            {@adressee Architect: ARCHITECT Text for element customer}
 * 
 *            {@adressee Tester: ARCHITECT Text for element customer}
 * 
 *            {@attribute lastName COMPARISON}
 * 
 *            {@adressee Devloper: ARCHITECT <code>null</code> is not
 *            permitted here!} {@adressee Architect: ARCHITECT Text for
 *            element customer} {@adressee Tester: ARCHITECT Text for
 *            element customer}
 * 
 * @return DEVELOPER TEXT for Return value
 */
```

# TODO #
  * Thomas just suggested to format the documentation-tables with ASCII-art. The ASCII-art is included into an inline-tag. Then we could replace the ASCII-art with HTML-elements for the Javadoc-export.
